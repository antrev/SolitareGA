**What is Solitaire**
Solitaire is a card game that you play by yourself. You only need a standard deck of 52 cards to play, so it's a great game to play when traveling alone or just when you are bored and want something to do. 

The first thing to do is deal out the cards into five columns. The first column on the left has one card, the second column has two cards, the third has three cards. This continues for the rest of the five columns including five cards in the fifth column. The top card in each column is turned face up, the rest of the cards are face down. 

**The Object of the Game in Solitaire** 

The goal of the game is to move all of the cards to the "foundations" these are four additional stacks of cards. At the start of the game these stacks are empty. Each stack represents a suit (hearts, clubs, etc). They must be stacked by suit and in order, starting with the Ace, then the 2, 3, 4,…..ending with the Queen and then King. 

**Playing the Game of Solitaire**

Cards that are face up and showing may be moved from the stock pile or the columns to the foundation stacks or to other columns. To move a card to a column, it must be one less in rank and the opposite color. For example, if it was a 9 of hearts (red), you could put an 8 of spades or clubs onto it. Stacks of cards may be moved from one column to another as long as they maintain the same order (highest to lowest, alternating colors). If you get an empty column, you can start a new column with a King. Any new column must be started with a King (or a stack of cards that starts with a King). To get new cards from the stock pile, you turn one or three cards at a time face up into the stack next to the stock pile called the waist stack. You can only play the top card off the waist stack. If you run out of stock cards, turn the waist stack over to make a new stock pile and start again, pulling the top three cards off, turning them over, and starting a new waist stack. 


<!-- Foreseen challenges or obstacles -->
1) Working with 6 Arrays and nesting objects into an multiple arrays,
2) making objects draggable, as this is a new feature that i will have to learn
3) creating logic to check if the clicked card is red || black
4) being able to move a column
